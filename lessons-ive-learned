Start with a small prototype.  Trying to think too far ahead just got me lost without a complete program to refer back to.  Tiny Prototype.  Build it up.
The mental clarity from this will be worth many times the time it takes to build. Ideas, as they pop up, should be noted but not immediately acted upon, lest you out-clever yourself and end up spending time on something silly up front.  Your first adventuregame is not the place to develop a text-adventure-creation DSL, no matter how cool the idea seems.  Getting shit done is psychologically important, too.
