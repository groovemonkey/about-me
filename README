################### About Dave ###################

Welcome to my Github account.  I'm Dave.

I'm obsessed with the idea of turning my ideas into 
useful things like software to create semi-permanent, 
perpetual value that other people will benefit from.

I'm a complete beginner when it comes to programming, 
software design and construction, and turning ideas 
into reality.  I'm told that with 10-15 years of 
focused, intelligent practice, I might be able to 
go from "complete beginner" to "beginner."

We'll see.
